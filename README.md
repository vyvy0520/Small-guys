**Overview**

This app can help everyone count their calories they need to consume in a day. In addition, it can help them count the BMI and Fat percent in their body. Through all the gathered data, our app can come up and provide a plan  for users to have a good diet as long as the exercises workout with the proper plan. Furthermore, This app also makes a level from basic to Advanced to help the trainer not feel panic when they start to plan their diet. I hope with this app people can make a good plan to diet and have a good body in the future.

**Functional Requirements**

When the app is first opened, it will display “Welcome to our fitness and diet app!” in bold at the top of the screen. 
A fitness image will be displayed at the middle of the screen.
Right below the image, the app will ask you “How can we help you?” and there will be 3 choices to choose from and they are all listed in a bulleted list in multiple choice format: “I want to lose weight”, “I want to maintain my weight”, and “I want to gain weight”.
Once the user clicks on one of the options, the app will turn the page and ask for their current weight and height and their goal weight.
Validations will appear when the user enters their current weight, height, and their goal weight. The height must be a double value rounded to 2 decimal places. If the user selects “I want to lose weight”, their current weight must be greater than their goal weight. If the user selects “I want to gain weight”, their current weight must be less than their goal weight. And if the user selects “I want to maintain my weight”, the app will turn to the next page. If any of the user inputs violate the requirements, an error message will appear at the bottom of the page. If all of the user inputs fulfill the requirements, it will go to the next page.
On the next page, the app will ask the user for the level of challenge. There will be 3 choices to choose from: “easy”, “medium”, and “hard” and they are listed in a bulleted, multiple choice format.
Once the user selects one of the options, a page describing the diet and workout plan will be displayed according to the level selected.
The user can always exit the app by clicking the “exit” button on the lower left corner of each page
When the “exit” button is pressed, the app will navigate to a page thanking the user for using the app.
